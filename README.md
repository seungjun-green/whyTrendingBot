## Problem Statement




## Introducing whyTrendingBot

All you need to do is just mention my bot with a word or hahstag you're interted in. Then it will reply back with a tweet that represent what people are talking about the topic.




## Technology Used

* Twitter API v1
* Twitter API v2
* Python, extract summary


## Future plans and improvements

* Multiple Language support

Rather than showing an English tweet always, make the bot reply with a tweet written in the same language as the word the user used.
